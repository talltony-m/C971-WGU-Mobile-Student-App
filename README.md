# C971-WGU-Mobile-Application
An Android and iOS application to track terms, courses and assesments for University students. Written in C# and SQLite. It has course start and end date/time notifications on the device home screen. The app has input exception validation. The Android version was tested and functions correctly. The iOS version was not tested. A wireframe PDF is also included. This is the final commit. I passed the course.
